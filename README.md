This is a basic telegram bot.

Before running this, you will need to install the python-telegram-bot library (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

You will need to be a group admin to add the bot account to your tg group.

If you want it to send files to your group, create a directory called /memes wherever you run this file from and load it full of dank memes to share.

Make sure the atom-file file just contains urls, one per line or things might break.
