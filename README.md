This is a basic telegram bot using python-telegram-bot library (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

If you want it to send files, create a directory called /memes wherever you run this file from and load it full of dank memes to share.

Make sure the atom-file file just contains urls, one per line or things might break.
